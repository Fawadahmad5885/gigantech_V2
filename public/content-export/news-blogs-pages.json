          "content": "When building with Strapi and Next.js, you usually fetch content from the Strapi backend using API calls. That works great — but what if you don't want to keep the Strapi server running all the time?\n\nThis was the exact situation I faced. I needed my Next.js frontend to work with the same Strapi content, but without making live API requests.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nI wanted my website to load content even when the Strapi backend was **not running**. That meant I needed a way to:\n\n- Export all Strapi content (collections, single types, etc.)\n- Save related media files (images, uploads)\n- Use this exported data in my frontend instead of calling the Strapi API\n\n## The Solution\n\nWith the help of ChatGPT, I wrote a small **export script** inside my Strapi project:\n\n*backend/src/scripts/export-content.js*\n\nRun using:\nnode export-content.js\n\nThe script does two things:\n1. Exports all Strapi data into JSON files inside:\n*frontend/public/content-export/*\n\n2. Copies all media files into:\n*frontend/public/content-export/uploads*\n\n\n## Using Static Data in Next.js\n\nInstead of fetching from the Strapi API, I updated my frontend helper:\n\n*frontend/src/lib/api.js*\n\nThe fetchStrapiData() function was modified to read from the exported JSON files. Now, the website loads data instantly without hitting the backend.\n\n## Why This Is Useful\n\n- No need to run Strapi in production if content doesn't change often\n\n- Faster load times (static files served directly)\n\n- Great for hosting on platforms like Vercel or Netlify\n\n- Still flexible: you can re-run the export script anytime content updates\n\n## Final Thoughts\nThis approach gave me the best of both worlds:\n\n- A powerful CMS (Strapi) for content management\n- A fast, static frontend (Next.js) for deployment\n\nIf you’re using Strapi + Next.js and want to avoid running the backend all the time, this method is simple and effective. Just export, save, and serve your content as static JSON. 🚀\n",

          "content": "I gave GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini Flash 2.5, DeepSeek DeepThink (R1), and Amazon Kiro the same complex coding task: a 3D neural network simulation in Three.js. Only one model came close to production-level quality.\n\n\n##  Why I Ran This Experiment\nMost LLM reviews show simple tasks: “write a landing page” or “generate a Python script.” But those don’t really tell us how these models behave under **real production-like complexity.**\n*I wanted to see how these models perform when asked to tackle a tightly constrained, visually verifiable, and mathematically precise coding challenge — one where mistakes are immediately obvious.*\nSo I wrote a **prompt about 1,500 tokens long,** spelling out every requirement of a **3D neural network visualization in Three.js.**\n![Dashboard](/blogs-images/3d-coding-challenge.png)\n\nThe article below includes only a structured summary of those requirements (for readability). But make no mistake: the actual spec was meticulous, covering exact math formulas, timing phases, firing rules, and strict boundary enforcement.\n## The Benchmark Problem\n\n### Task (summary of original prompt):\n\nCreate a professional 3D neural network visualization using **Three.js** that demonstrates dynamic shape morphing, neural activity simulation, interactive camera controls, and perfect geometric containment of all neural elements.\n\n---\n\n## Highlights of the Requirements\n\n### 🔹 Shapes & Morphing\n- Cycle through 5 shapes in strict order: **Sphere → Cone → Cube → Pyramid → Cylinder**  \n- Smooth morphing transitions, infinite loop  \n\n### 🔹 Neurons & Connections\n- Exactly **1,200 neurons** (white wireframe spheres)  \n- At least **3 connections per neuron**, proximity-based  \n- **Zero tolerance** for neurons or links outside the shape boundary  \n\n### 🔹 Activity Simulation\n- Random neurons fire every **150ms (~1.5%)**\n- Red “meteor effect” travels along links.\n- Destination neuron glows red and scales 3x for 800ms, then resets.\n### 🔹Camera & Interaction\n- Interactive rotation with mouse; gentle auto-rotation fallback.\n- Cinematic zoom-in (3s) and zoom-out (3s), synced with morph transitions.\n- Smooth easing, no jerky movements.\n\n### 🔹Performance\n- 60fps target.\n- Memory-efficient cleanup of effects.\n- Responsive resizing.\n- Single HTML file with Three.js via CDN.\n\nIn short: **a professional-grade animation system** that would expose weaknesses in any model’s reasoning or code structure.\n\n## The Test Setup\n\nI tested five LLMs:\n\n- **Chat interfaces:** GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini Flash 2.5, DeepSeek DeepThink (R1)  \n- **Software development environment:** Amazon Kiro  \n\nEvery model received the same requirements. I evaluated them on **accuracy, containment, animation quality, and refinement potential**.\n\n---\n\n## Results by Model\n\n### GPT-5 (Chat UI)\n\nGPT-5 generated workable code, but with serious issues:\n\n- Neurons consistently **leaked outside shape boundaries**.  \n- Connections were extended incorrectly.  \n- Neuron firing lacked polish and synchronization.  \n- Even with multiple refinement prompts, shapes stayed messy.  \n\nUsing **GPT-5 Agents** (longer reasoning) prolonged the process but didn’t fix alignment errors — cones inverted, pyramids misplaced, neurons still out of bounds.\n\n**Verdict:** Ambitious, but ultimately unreliable for this kind of strict geometry.\n\n### Claude Sonnet 4 (Chat UI)\n\nClaude performed better than GPT-5:\n\n- More structured output and closer adherence to requirements.  \n- Shapes looked cleaner, firing slightly more naturally.  \n\nBut…\n\n- Neurons still escaped boundaries.  \n- Links didn’t always update correctly.  \n- After 5–7 refinement prompts, things improved, but never reached spec.  \n\n**Verdict:** Better discipline than GPT-5, but still not production-ready.  \n\n---\n\n### Gemini Flash 2.5 (Chat UI)\n\nWhen given the prompt, Gemini replied with:\n\n*I am unable to generate a complete and functional HTML file with the complex Three.js code you’ve requested. My capabilities are limited to providing information and generating text or images, and I cannot create a fully-coded, executable web page.*\n\n**Verdict:** Refreshingly honest, but ultimately a non-result for this test.\n### DeepSeek DeepThink (R1) (Chat UI)\n\nMarketed as a “thinking” model, DeepSeek showed the same execution gaps as GPT and Claude:\n\n- Out-of-bounds neurons.  \n- Misaligned links.  \n- Firing animations lacked precision.\n  \nReasoning ability didn’t translate into technical correctness here.  \n\n**Verdict:** Same flaws, different branding.  \n\n---\n\n### Amazon Kiro (Software Dev Environment)\n\nThis was the surprise.  \n\nUnlike the chat UIs, Kiro didn’t just dump code. It followed a structured development workflow:\n\n1. Converted my long prompt into a Markdown requirements doc.  \n2. Translated that into a design specification.  \n3. Broke it down into a task list.  \n4. Then generated the implementation.  \n\nThe first attempt missed a few requirements. But when I asked:  \n\n> Are you sure you implemented all the requirements?  \n\nKiro did something no other model did:  \n\n- It checked its work against the requirements list.  \n- Found the gaps.  \n- Fixed them in the next iteration with a single prompt.  \n\nThe final result hit about **95% of the full spec**.  \n\n**Verdict:** The only LLM-based system in this test that was able to implement all the requirements correctly.  \n## Final Rankings  \n\n🥇 **Amazon Kiro** → Clear winner. Met nearly all requirements with minimal prompting.  \n🥈 **Claude Sonnet 4.0** → Strong attempt, but too much manual refinement needed.  \n🥉 **GPT-5** → Ambitious but messy and inconsistent.  \n🎭 **DeepSeek Think (R1)** → Same flaws as GPT/Claude, despite “reasoning” claims.  \n🚫 **Gemini Flash 2.5** → Did not attempt implementation.  \n\n---\n\n## Takeaways  \n\n1. **Long, detailed prompts expose model weaknesses.**  \n   The 1,500-token spec I provided was deliberately precise, and most models struggled to stay within those constraints.  \n\n2. **Chat UIs aren’t enough for production-level tasks.**  \n   GPT, Claude, DeepSeek, and Gemini behaved like “helpers.” They don’t enforce discipline unless you spoon-feed corrections for hours.  \n\n3. **Requirement verification is the difference-maker.**  \n   Amazon Kiro stood out because it didn’t just generate code — it cross-checked requirements, found gaps, and corrected them. That’s what made it succeed where others failed.  \n\n---\n\n## Closing Thoughts  \n\nThis experiment convinced me of something bigger:  \n\nFuture LLMs won’t just be about being “smarter.” They’ll need to adopt structured engineering workflows — breaking problems down, checking against specs, and iterating systematically.  \n\nBecause in real-world coding, intelligence without verification isn’t enough.  \n\nAnd for now, **Kiro is the only LLM-based system I’ve tested that was able to implement all the requirements correctly.**  \n\n---\n\n**Note:** Some of the content is AI-generated.  \n\n",

          "content": "## Executive Summary\n\nExcel is one of the most widely used tools for managing and sharing data. Yet, extracting structured and meaningful information from `.xlsx` files is often harder than it seems. Our team set out to find a solution that could reliably parse **tables and text together**, maintain **context and formatting**, and work without relying on **paid APIs or external services**.  \n\nAfter exploring several libraries and approaches, we discovered **Docling**, a solution that balanced flexibility, scalability, and reliability, making it the best fit for our needs.\n\n---\n\n![Excel to Structured Output](general.png)\n\n---\n\n## Challenges\n\nAt first glance, parsing Excel sounds straightforward. But when we started working with real-world files, we quickly ran into roadblocks:\n\n- **Different table types**: Some files used native Excel tables, while others had only simple tabular ranges. Most tools could handle one type but not both.  \n- **Context loss**: In many cases, tables were surrounded by important explanatory text. Traditional libraries ignored this, leaving us with incomplete data.  \n- **Table boundaries**: Detecting where a table started and ended became tricky, especially when multiple tables existed in the same sheet.  \n- **Maintenance burden**: The more logic we added to patch gaps in existing libraries, the more brittle and complex the system became.  \n- **Scalability issues**: Our solution had to process thousands of files, not just a handful. Performance and reliability mattered.  \n\nThese challenges motivated us to step back and rethink our approach.\n\n---\n\n## Motivation\n\nOur motivation was simple but clear:  \n\nWe wanted to build a **robust, free, and local-first tool** that could parse Excel files while **retaining both tables and context**. Specifically, the tool needed to:  \n\n- Parse **native tables** as well as **simple tabular ranges**.  \n- Extract **tables together with text**, not in isolation.  \n- Preserve **formatting and relationships** between data and notes.  \n- Append **text alongside tables** when needed for clarity.  \n- Avoid dependency on **paid APIs** or complex external setups.  \n\nThis vision kept us grounded as we experimented with different methods.\n\n---\n\n##  Methods We Tried\n\n### 1. **Pandas**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Widely known and very easy to use.\n  - Great for loading simple tables into DataFrames.  \n- **Cons:**\n  - Could not detect **native Excel tables**.\n  - Required heavy **custom table-boundary logic**.\n  - Failed to capture surrounding context.  \n\n**Verdict:** Solid for basic jobs but not enough for complex parsing.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **OpenPyXL**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Reads **native Excel tables** and cell text.  \n- **Cons:**\n  - Missed **simple tabular ranges**.  \n  - Still demanded extra parsing logic to unify outputs.  \n\n**Verdict:** A step up from Pandas, but still incomplete.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **LlamaIndex**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Provides an **end-to-end pipeline**: parsing + querying.  \n- **Cons:**\n  - Required **two API keys** (Llama Parse + OpenAI).  \n  - Depended on **paid APIs**, against our free/local requirement.  \n\n**Verdict:** Too costly and external for our workflow.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Marker**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Offered both **LLM-powered** and **non-LLM** modes.  \n  - The LLM version delivered impressive parsing results.  \n- **Cons:**\n  - LLM mode consumed **too many OpenAI tokens**, driving up costs.  \n  - Non-LLM mode often **hallucinated tags** and produced errors.  \n  - Required significant **post-processing**.  \n\n**Verdict:** Interesting experiment, but unstable and costly.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Docling (Final Choice)**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Strong parsing engine capable of handling **tables + text**.  \n  - Multiple export options: **Dict, HTML, Text, Element Nodes**, and more.  \n  - Local-first, no reliance on external APIs.  \n- **Cons:**\n  - Export formats each had small quirks.  \n- **Solution:**\n  - We standardized on the **`dict` export** for flexibility.  \n  - Added custom logic to handle quirks and standardize outputs.  \n\n**Verdict:** Flexible, scalable, and powerful enough for production.\n\n---\n\n## Example Applications\n\nDocling can be applied in real-world scenarios such as:  \n\n- **Financial reporting**: Parsing monthly Excel reports into structured data for automated dashboards.  \n- **Survey analysis**: Extracting tabular responses along with explanatory notes for research insights.  \n- **Operational logs**: Capturing tables from Excel logs while retaining context from comments and footnotes.  \n- **Data migration**: Converting legacy Excel-based datasets into standardized formats for new systems.  \n- **Compliance audits**: Extracting both tables and supporting text from Excel-based audit reports for validation.  \n\n---\n\n## Business Impact\n\nSwitching to Docling delivered clear results:  \n\n- **50–70% reduction in engineering effort**: Developers no longer needed to maintain complex parsing logic.  \n- **Higher accuracy**: Tables and surrounding notes were consistently extracted, reducing manual corrections.  \n- **Cost savings**: Avoiding paid APIs removed recurring expenses.  \n- **Significant time savings**: For example, processing a batch of 500 Excel reports that previously required multiple analysts now takes a few hours on a single machine.  \n- **Improved decision-making**: Teams gained quicker access to accurate, structured data for reporting and analysis.  \n\n---\n\n## Performance Results\n\nWe also measured Docling’s performance against our needs:  \n\n**Test Case 1 – Cell values as strings**  \n![Performance Results 1](/blogs-images/excel-blog-performance1.png)\n\n**Test Case 2 – Cell values as floats**  \n![Performance Results 2](/blogs-images/excel-blog-performance2.png)\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nParsing Excel at scale is harder than it looks, most tools solve one piece of the puzzle but fall short elsewhere. Through trial and error, we found **Docling** to be the most **complete and reliable solution**, balancing accuracy, scalability, and flexibility.  \n\nBy adopting Docling, organizations can **streamline their data workflows, reduce costs, and unlock more value** from Excel-based information at scale.
