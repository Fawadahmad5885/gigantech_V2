          "content": "When building with Strapi and Next.js, you usually fetch content from the Strapi backend using API calls. That works great ‚Äî but what if you don't want to keep the Strapi server running all the time?\n\nThis was the exact situation I faced. I needed my Next.js frontend to work with the same Strapi content, but without making live API requests.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nI wanted my website to load content even when the Strapi backend was **not running**. That meant I needed a way to:\n\n- Export all Strapi content (collections, single types, etc.)\n- Save related media files (images, uploads)\n- Use this exported data in my frontend instead of calling the Strapi API\n\n## The Solution\n\nWith the help of ChatGPT, I wrote a small **export script** inside my Strapi project:\n\n*backend/src/scripts/export-content.js*\n\nRun using:\nnode export-content.js\n\nThe script does two things:\n1. Exports all Strapi data into JSON files inside:\n*frontend/public/content-export/*\n\n2. Copies all media files into:\n*frontend/public/content-export/uploads*\n\n\n## Using Static Data in Next.js\n\nInstead of fetching from the Strapi API, I updated my frontend helper:\n\n*frontend/src/lib/api.js*\n\nThe fetchStrapiData() function was modified to read from the exported JSON files. Now, the website loads data instantly without hitting the backend.\n\n## Why This Is Useful\n\n- No need to run Strapi in production if content doesn't change often\n\n- Faster load times (static files served directly)\n\n- Great for hosting on platforms like Vercel or Netlify\n\n- Still flexible: you can re-run the export script anytime content updates\n\n## Final Thoughts\nThis approach gave me the best of both worlds:\n\n- A powerful CMS (Strapi) for content management\n- A fast, static frontend (Next.js) for deployment\n\nIf you‚Äôre using Strapi + Next.js and want to avoid running the backend all the time, this method is simple and effective. Just export, save, and serve your content as static JSON. üöÄ\n",

          "content": "I gave GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini Flash 2.5, DeepSeek DeepThink (R1), and Amazon Kiro the same complex coding task: a 3D neural network simulation in Three.js. Only one model came close to production-level quality.\n\n\n##  Why I Ran This Experiment\nMost LLM reviews show simple tasks: ‚Äúwrite a landing page‚Äù or ‚Äúgenerate a Python script.‚Äù But those don‚Äôt really tell us how these models behave under **real production-like complexity.**\n*I wanted to see how these models perform when asked to tackle a tightly constrained, visually verifiable, and mathematically precise coding challenge ‚Äî one where mistakes are immediately obvious.*\nSo I wrote a **prompt about 1,500 tokens long,** spelling out every requirement of a **3D neural network visualization in Three.js.**\n![Dashboard](/blogs-images/3d-coding-challenge.png)\n\nThe article below includes only a structured summary of those requirements (for readability). But make no mistake: the actual spec was meticulous, covering exact math formulas, timing phases, firing rules, and strict boundary enforcement.\n## The Benchmark Problem\n\n### Task (summary of original prompt):\n\nCreate a professional 3D neural network visualization using **Three.js** that demonstrates dynamic shape morphing, neural activity simulation, interactive camera controls, and perfect geometric containment of all neural elements.\n\n---\n\n## Highlights of the Requirements\n\n### üîπ Shapes & Morphing\n- Cycle through 5 shapes in strict order: **Sphere ‚Üí Cone ‚Üí Cube ‚Üí Pyramid ‚Üí Cylinder**  \n- Smooth morphing transitions, infinite loop  \n\n### üîπ Neurons & Connections\n- Exactly **1,200 neurons** (white wireframe spheres)  \n- At least **3 connections per neuron**, proximity-based  \n- **Zero tolerance** for neurons or links outside the shape boundary  \n\n### üîπ Activity Simulation\n- Random neurons fire every **150ms (~1.5%)**\n- Red ‚Äúmeteor effect‚Äù travels along links.\n- Destination neuron glows red and scales 3x for 800ms, then resets.\n### üîπCamera & Interaction\n- Interactive rotation with mouse; gentle auto-rotation fallback.\n- Cinematic zoom-in (3s) and zoom-out (3s), synced with morph transitions.\n- Smooth easing, no jerky movements.\n\n### üîπPerformance\n- 60fps target.\n- Memory-efficient cleanup of effects.\n- Responsive resizing.\n- Single HTML file with Three.js via CDN.\n\nIn short: **a professional-grade animation system** that would expose weaknesses in any model‚Äôs reasoning or code structure.\n\n## The Test Setup\n\nI tested five LLMs:\n\n- **Chat interfaces:** GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini Flash 2.5, DeepSeek DeepThink (R1)  \n- **Software development environment:** Amazon Kiro  \n\nEvery model received the same requirements. I evaluated them on **accuracy, containment, animation quality, and refinement potential**.\n\n---\n\n## Results by Model\n\n### GPT-5 (Chat UI)\n\nGPT-5 generated workable code, but with serious issues:\n\n- Neurons consistently **leaked outside shape boundaries**.  \n- Connections were extended incorrectly.  \n- Neuron firing lacked polish and synchronization.  \n- Even with multiple refinement prompts, shapes stayed messy.  \n\nUsing **GPT-5 Agents** (longer reasoning) prolonged the process but didn‚Äôt fix alignment errors ‚Äî cones inverted, pyramids misplaced, neurons still out of bounds.\n\n**Verdict:** Ambitious, but ultimately unreliable for this kind of strict geometry.\n\n### Claude Sonnet 4 (Chat UI)\n\nClaude performed better than GPT-5:\n\n- More structured output and closer adherence to requirements.  \n- Shapes looked cleaner, firing slightly more naturally.  \n\nBut‚Ä¶\n\n- Neurons still escaped boundaries.  \n- Links didn‚Äôt always update correctly.  \n- After 5‚Äì7 refinement prompts, things improved, but never reached spec.  \n\n**Verdict:** Better discipline than GPT-5, but still not production-ready.  \n\n---\n\n### Gemini Flash 2.5 (Chat UI)\n\nWhen given the prompt, Gemini replied with:\n\n*I am unable to generate a complete and functional HTML file with the complex Three.js code you‚Äôve requested. My capabilities are limited to providing information and generating text or images, and I cannot create a fully-coded, executable web page.*\n\n**Verdict:** Refreshingly honest, but ultimately a non-result for this test.\n### DeepSeek DeepThink (R1) (Chat UI)\n\nMarketed as a ‚Äúthinking‚Äù model, DeepSeek showed the same execution gaps as GPT and Claude:\n\n- Out-of-bounds neurons.  \n- Misaligned links.  \n- Firing animations lacked precision.\n  \nReasoning ability didn‚Äôt translate into technical correctness here.  \n\n**Verdict:** Same flaws, different branding.  \n\n---\n\n### Amazon Kiro (Software Dev Environment)\n\nThis was the surprise.  \n\nUnlike the chat UIs, Kiro didn‚Äôt just dump code. It followed a structured development workflow:\n\n1. Converted my long prompt into a Markdown requirements doc.  \n2. Translated that into a design specification.  \n3. Broke it down into a task list.  \n4. Then generated the implementation.  \n\nThe first attempt missed a few requirements. But when I asked:  \n\n> Are you sure you implemented all the requirements?  \n\nKiro did something no other model did:  \n\n- It checked its work against the requirements list.  \n- Found the gaps.  \n- Fixed them in the next iteration with a single prompt.  \n\nThe final result hit about **95% of the full spec**.  \n\n**Verdict:** The only LLM-based system in this test that was able to implement all the requirements correctly.  \n## Final Rankings  \n\nü•á **Amazon Kiro** ‚Üí Clear winner. Met nearly all requirements with minimal prompting.  \nü•à **Claude Sonnet 4.0** ‚Üí Strong attempt, but too much manual refinement needed.  \nü•â **GPT-5** ‚Üí Ambitious but messy and inconsistent.  \nüé≠ **DeepSeek Think (R1)** ‚Üí Same flaws as GPT/Claude, despite ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù claims.  \nüö´ **Gemini Flash 2.5** ‚Üí Did not attempt implementation.  \n\n---\n\n## Takeaways  \n\n1. **Long, detailed prompts expose model weaknesses.**  \n   The 1,500-token spec I provided was deliberately precise, and most models struggled to stay within those constraints.  \n\n2. **Chat UIs aren‚Äôt enough for production-level tasks.**  \n   GPT, Claude, DeepSeek, and Gemini behaved like ‚Äúhelpers.‚Äù They don‚Äôt enforce discipline unless you spoon-feed corrections for hours.  \n\n3. **Requirement verification is the difference-maker.**  \n   Amazon Kiro stood out because it didn‚Äôt just generate code ‚Äî it cross-checked requirements, found gaps, and corrected them. That‚Äôs what made it succeed where others failed.  \n\n---\n\n## Closing Thoughts  \n\nThis experiment convinced me of something bigger:  \n\nFuture LLMs won‚Äôt just be about being ‚Äúsmarter.‚Äù They‚Äôll need to adopt structured engineering workflows ‚Äî breaking problems down, checking against specs, and iterating systematically.  \n\nBecause in real-world coding, intelligence without verification isn‚Äôt enough.  \n\nAnd for now, **Kiro is the only LLM-based system I‚Äôve tested that was able to implement all the requirements correctly.**  \n\n---\n\n**Note:** Some of the content is AI-generated.  \n\n",

          "content": "## Executive Summary\n\nExcel is one of the most widely used tools for managing and sharing data. Yet, extracting structured and meaningful information from `.xlsx` files is often harder than it seems. Our team set out to find a solution that could reliably parse **tables and text together**, maintain **context and formatting**, and work without relying on **paid APIs or external services**.  \n\nAfter exploring several libraries and approaches, we discovered **Docling**, a solution that balanced flexibility, scalability, and reliability, making it the best fit for our needs.\n\n---\n\n![Excel to Structured Output](general.png)\n\n---\n\n## Challenges\n\nAt first glance, parsing Excel sounds straightforward. But when we started working with real-world files, we quickly ran into roadblocks:\n\n- **Different table types**: Some files used native Excel tables, while others had only simple tabular ranges. Most tools could handle one type but not both.  \n- **Context loss**: In many cases, tables were surrounded by important explanatory text. Traditional libraries ignored this, leaving us with incomplete data.  \n- **Table boundaries**: Detecting where a table started and ended became tricky, especially when multiple tables existed in the same sheet.  \n- **Maintenance burden**: The more logic we added to patch gaps in existing libraries, the more brittle and complex the system became.  \n- **Scalability issues**: Our solution had to process thousands of files, not just a handful. Performance and reliability mattered.  \n\nThese challenges motivated us to step back and rethink our approach.\n\n---\n\n## Motivation\n\nOur motivation was simple but clear:  \n\nWe wanted to build a **robust, free, and local-first tool** that could parse Excel files while **retaining both tables and context**. Specifically, the tool needed to:  \n\n- Parse **native tables** as well as **simple tabular ranges**.  \n- Extract **tables together with text**, not in isolation.  \n- Preserve **formatting and relationships** between data and notes.  \n- Append **text alongside tables** when needed for clarity.  \n- Avoid dependency on **paid APIs** or complex external setups.  \n\nThis vision kept us grounded as we experimented with different methods.\n\n---\n\n##  Methods We Tried\n\n### 1. **Pandas**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Widely known and very easy to use.\n  - Great for loading simple tables into DataFrames.  \n- **Cons:**\n  - Could not detect **native Excel tables**.\n  - Required heavy **custom table-boundary logic**.\n  - Failed to capture surrounding context.  \n\n**Verdict:** Solid for basic jobs but not enough for complex parsing.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **OpenPyXL**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Reads **native Excel tables** and cell text.  \n- **Cons:**\n  - Missed **simple tabular ranges**.  \n  - Still demanded extra parsing logic to unify outputs.  \n\n**Verdict:** A step up from Pandas, but still incomplete.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **LlamaIndex**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Provides an **end-to-end pipeline**: parsing + querying.  \n- **Cons:**\n  - Required **two API keys** (Llama Parse + OpenAI).  \n  - Depended on **paid APIs**, against our free/local requirement.  \n\n**Verdict:** Too costly and external for our workflow.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Marker**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Offered both **LLM-powered** and **non-LLM** modes.  \n  - The LLM version delivered impressive parsing results.  \n- **Cons:**\n  - LLM mode consumed **too many OpenAI tokens**, driving up costs.  \n  - Non-LLM mode often **hallucinated tags** and produced errors.  \n  - Required significant **post-processing**.  \n\n**Verdict:** Interesting experiment, but unstable and costly.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Docling (Final Choice)**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Strong parsing engine capable of handling **tables + text**.  \n  - Multiple export options: **Dict, HTML, Text, Element Nodes**, and more.  \n  - Local-first, no reliance on external APIs.  \n- **Cons:**\n  - Export formats each had small quirks.  \n- **Solution:**\n  - We standardized on the **`dict` export** for flexibility.  \n  - Added custom logic to handle quirks and standardize outputs.  \n\n**Verdict:** Flexible, scalable, and powerful enough for production.\n\n---\n\n## Example Applications\n\nDocling can be applied in real-world scenarios such as:  \n\n- **Financial reporting**: Parsing monthly Excel reports into structured data for automated dashboards.  \n- **Survey analysis**: Extracting tabular responses along with explanatory notes for research insights.  \n- **Operational logs**: Capturing tables from Excel logs while retaining context from comments and footnotes.  \n- **Data migration**: Converting legacy Excel-based datasets into standardized formats for new systems.  \n- **Compliance audits**: Extracting both tables and supporting text from Excel-based audit reports for validation.  \n\n---\n\n## Business Impact\n\nSwitching to Docling delivered clear results:  \n\n- **50‚Äì70% reduction in engineering effort**: Developers no longer needed to maintain complex parsing logic.  \n- **Higher accuracy**: Tables and surrounding notes were consistently extracted, reducing manual corrections.  \n- **Cost savings**: Avoiding paid APIs removed recurring expenses.  \n- **Significant time savings**: For example, processing a batch of 500 Excel reports that previously required multiple analysts now takes a few hours on a single machine.  \n- **Improved decision-making**: Teams gained quicker access to accurate, structured data for reporting and analysis.  \n\n---\n\n## Performance Results\n\nWe also measured Docling‚Äôs performance against our needs:  \n\n**Test Case 1 ‚Äì Cell values as strings**  \n![Performance Results 1](/blogs-images/excel-blog-performance1.png)\n\n**Test Case 2 ‚Äì Cell values as floats**  \n![Performance Results 2](/blogs-images/excel-blog-performance2.png)\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nParsing Excel at scale is harder than it looks, most tools solve one piece of the puzzle but fall short elsewhere. Through trial and error, we found **Docling** to be the most **complete and reliable solution**, balancing accuracy, scalability, and flexibility.  \n\nBy adopting Docling, organizations can **streamline their data workflows, reduce costs, and unlock more value** from Excel-based information at scale.
