      "content": "I gave GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini Flash 2.5, DeepSeek DeepThink (R1), and Amazon Kiro the same complex coding task: a 3D neural network simulation in Three.js. Only one model came close to production-level quality.\n\n\n##  Why I Ran This Experiment\nMost LLM reviews show simple tasks: “write a landing page” or “generate a Python script.” But those don’t really tell us how these models behave under **real production-like complexity.**\n*I wanted to see how these models perform when asked to tackle a tightly constrained, visually verifiable, and mathematically precise coding challenge — one where mistakes are immediately obvious.*\nSo I wrote a **prompt about 1,500 tokens long,** spelling out every requirement of a **3D neural network visualization in Three.js.**\n![Dashboard](/blogs-images/3d-coding-challenge.png)\n\nThe article below includes only a structured summary of those requirements (for readability). But make no mistake: the actual spec was meticulous, covering exact math formulas, timing phases, firing rules, and strict boundary enforcement.\n## The Benchmark Problem\n\n### Task (summary of original prompt):\n\nCreate a professional 3D neural network visualization using **Three.js** that demonstrates dynamic shape morphing, neural activity simulation, interactive camera controls, and perfect geometric containment of all neural elements.\n\n---\n\n## Highlights of the Requirements\n\n### 🔹 Shapes & Morphing\n- Cycle through 5 shapes in strict order: **Sphere → Cone → Cube → Pyramid → Cylinder**  \n- Smooth morphing transitions, infinite loop  \n\n### 🔹 Neurons & Connections\n- Exactly **1,200 neurons** (white wireframe spheres)  \n- At least **3 connections per neuron**, proximity-based  \n- **Zero tolerance** for neurons or links outside the shape boundary  \n\n### 🔹 Activity Simulation\n- Random neurons fire every **150ms (~1.5%)**\n- Red “meteor effect” travels along links.\n- Destination neuron glows red and scales 3x for 800ms, then resets.\n### 🔹Camera & Interaction\n- Interactive rotation with mouse; gentle auto-rotation fallback.\n- Cinematic zoom-in (3s) and zoom-out (3s), synced with morph transitions.\n- Smooth easing, no jerky movements.\n\n### 🔹Performance\n- 60fps target.\n- Memory-efficient cleanup of effects.\n- Responsive resizing.\n- Single HTML file with Three.js via CDN.\n\nIn short: **a professional-grade animation system** that would expose weaknesses in any model’s reasoning or code structure.\n\n## The Test Setup\n\nI tested five LLMs:\n\n- **Chat interfaces:** GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini Flash 2.5, DeepSeek DeepThink (R1)  \n- **Software development environment:** Amazon Kiro  \n\nEvery model received the same requirements. I evaluated them on **accuracy, containment, animation quality, and refinement potential**.\n\n---\n\n## Results by Model\n\n### GPT-5 (Chat UI)\n\nGPT-5 generated workable code, but with serious issues:\n\n- Neurons consistently **leaked outside shape boundaries**.  \n- Connections were extended incorrectly.  \n- Neuron firing lacked polish and synchronization.  \n- Even with multiple refinement prompts, shapes stayed messy.  \n\nUsing **GPT-5 Agents** (longer reasoning) prolonged the process but didn’t fix alignment errors — cones inverted, pyramids misplaced, neurons still out of bounds.\n\n**Verdict:** Ambitious, but ultimately unreliable for this kind of strict geometry.\n\n### Claude Sonnet 4 (Chat UI)\n\nClaude performed better than GPT-5:\n\n- More structured output and closer adherence to requirements.  \n- Shapes looked cleaner, firing slightly more naturally.  \n\nBut…\n\n- Neurons still escaped boundaries.  \n- Links didn’t always update correctly.  \n- After 5–7 refinement prompts, things improved, but never reached spec.  \n\n**Verdict:** Better discipline than GPT-5, but still not production-ready.  \n\n---\n\n### Gemini Flash 2.5 (Chat UI)\n\nWhen given the prompt, Gemini replied with:\n\n*I am unable to generate a complete and functional HTML file with the complex Three.js code you’ve requested. My capabilities are limited to providing information and generating text or images, and I cannot create a fully-coded, executable web page.*\n\n**Verdict:** Refreshingly honest, but ultimately a non-result for this test.\n### DeepSeek DeepThink (R1) (Chat UI)\n\nMarketed as a “thinking” model, DeepSeek showed the same execution gaps as GPT and Claude:\n\n- Out-of-bounds neurons.  \n- Misaligned links.  \n- Firing animations lacked precision.\n  \nReasoning ability didn’t translate into technical correctness here.  \n\n**Verdict:** Same flaws, different branding.  \n\n---\n\n### Amazon Kiro (Software Dev Environment)\n\nThis was the surprise.  \n\nUnlike the chat UIs, Kiro didn’t just dump code. It followed a structured development workflow:\n\n1. Converted my long prompt into a Markdown requirements doc.  \n2. Translated that into a design specification.  \n3. Broke it down into a task list.  \n4. Then generated the implementation.  \n\nThe first attempt missed a few requirements. But when I asked:  \n\n> Are you sure you implemented all the requirements?  \n\nKiro did something no other model did:  \n\n- It checked its work against the requirements list.  \n- Found the gaps.  \n- Fixed them in the next iteration with a single prompt.  \n\nThe final result hit about **95% of the full spec**.  \n\n**Verdict:** The only LLM-based system in this test that was able to implement all the requirements correctly.  \n## Final Rankings  \n\n🥇 **Amazon Kiro** → Clear winner. Met nearly all requirements with minimal prompting.  \n🥈 **Claude Sonnet 4.0** → Strong attempt, but too much manual refinement needed.  \n🥉 **GPT-5** → Ambitious but messy and inconsistent.  \n🎭 **DeepSeek Think (R1)** → Same flaws as GPT/Claude, despite “reasoning” claims.  \n🚫 **Gemini Flash 2.5** → Did not attempt implementation.  \n\n---\n\n## Takeaways  \n\n1. **Long, detailed prompts expose model weaknesses.**  \n   The 1,500-token spec I provided was deliberately precise, and most models struggled to stay within those constraints.  \n\n2. **Chat UIs aren’t enough for production-level tasks.**  \n   GPT, Claude, DeepSeek, and Gemini behaved like “helpers.” They don’t enforce discipline unless you spoon-feed corrections for hours.  \n\n3. **Requirement verification is the difference-maker.**  \n   Amazon Kiro stood out because it didn’t just generate code — it cross-checked requirements, found gaps, and corrected them. That’s what made it succeed where others failed.  \n\n---\n\n## Closing Thoughts  \n\nThis experiment convinced me of something bigger:  \n\nFuture LLMs won’t just be about being “smarter.” They’ll need to adopt structured engineering workflows — breaking problems down, checking against specs, and iterating systematically.  \n\nBecause in real-world coding, intelligence without verification isn’t enough.  \n\nAnd for now, **Kiro is the only LLM-based system I’ve tested that was able to implement all the requirements correctly.**  \n\n---\n\n**Note:** Some of the content is AI-generated.  \n\n",
